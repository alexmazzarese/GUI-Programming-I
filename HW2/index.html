  Background:
  </h2>

  <section>

  <p>
  Since the very young age of 9, I have had an extremely strong connection with music. That same year my dad got me my first guitar and taught me how to play. From there, I would later learn 5 other instruments, acquire the skills and tools necessary for music production, and get accepted to Berklee School of Music. But although my passion for music was strong, It wasn't until I found Computer Science that I truly began to find myself academically and professionally. 
  </p>
  <p>
  After graduating from Andover High School in 2015, I attended the University of Vermont for about a year studying Electrical Engineering. However, after much debate I decided to return back to Massachusetts to pursue education where I could recieve in-state tuition rates. Once I returned back to Massachusetts, I tried taking a coding class at Middlesex Community College, and fell in love instantly.
  </p>
  <p>
  Once I finally transferred to UMass Lowell, I instantly joined the Computer Science major. I found that computer science helped me accomplish all my academic goals, as well as personal goals relating to my interests in music and selling clothing online. One of my current ventures is attempting to design a VST (Vitual Studio Techonology) app of my very own, using my knowledge of both coding and music! I look forward to pursuing work in the computing and music fields in the years to come, after graduating with my bachelors in Computer Science from UMass Lowell.
